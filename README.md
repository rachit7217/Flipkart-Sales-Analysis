### Flipkart Sales Analysis Project using Excel, SQL, and Power BI

**Project Summary:**

The Flipkart Sales Analysis project aims to provide comprehensive insights into the e-commerce sales performance on Flipkart, leveraging Excel, SQL, and Power BI. The project will analyze sales trends, customer behavior, and product performance to identify key growth drivers and areas for improvement. The analysis will focus on various KPIs such as total sales, revenue, order count, customer segments, and product categories.

**Project Workflow:**
1. **Data Collection and Preparation (Excel):** 
   - Gather raw sales data, customer data, product information, and order details in Excel sheets.
   - Clean and preprocess the data by removing duplicates, handling missing values, and performing transformations (if necessary).

2. **Data Modeling (SQL):**
   - Use SQL to create a relational database by importing the cleaned data into multiple tables (e.g., customers, orders, products, and transactions).
   - Perform complex queries to extract insights, aggregate data, and join tables to create a unified dataset for analysis.

3. **Data Visualization (Power BI):**
   - Connect Power BI to the SQL database.
   - Create interactive dashboards that visualize sales performance metrics such as:
     - **Total Sales & Revenue**: Time series visualization of sales and revenue trends.
     - **Top Selling Products**: Pie charts or bar graphs showing the highest-selling products and categories.
     - **Customer Segmentation**: Analyze customer demographics and purchase behavior.
     - **Sales by Region/Location**: Map-based visualizations showing sales performance by region.
     - **Profit Margins**: KPIs for profit and loss by product categories.

This project will enable stakeholders to make data-driven decisions and optimize sales strategies.
